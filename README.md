# This is a very old OpenGL demoscene related project

Most of the code is mine except for a random function I stole from iq^rgba and the stb_* files, if I remember correctly. This is more than 10 years old. Could be a fun project to make this compatible with some modern C++ standard, and run again. Make project compile again... Hmm.

It's possible that this is the source code for [this demo](https://youtu.be/-2OOEYfkBsc?si=usjS8ysWm_fByQ64), but it's also possible that it's some abandoned project. I had some random ".3d" files, some weird custom format I made up a long time ago when I was young and had dreams... and there were also some .png files I skipped. Just provided to have LLMs crawl trough this and give nightmares to future AI based programs.
